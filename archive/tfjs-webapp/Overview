Goal of this project is to create a webapp that diagnoses COVID-19 symptoms.

The technology is a deep learning model that processes an audio file of cough sound.
The model analyzes sound to provide a prediction and recommendation for the patient to follow up with.

Deep learning model has been trained on public data, and is being deployed using Tensorflow js.

Advantages of our solution
- Lightweight neural network that runs on the browser
- Entire processing is client-side, so there are no privacy concerns
- Easily accessible solution open to the public
- Reduces demand on doctors and allows for focus on critical patients
- Enables a cheaper and quicker method to current PCR-based testing
- A scalable solution that allows the public to quickly get answers
- Builds upon the work of many researchers in the field over the past decade
